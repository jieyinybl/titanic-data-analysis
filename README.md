# Titanic Survival Data Exploration

## Introduction to Task and Dataset

This is one of the udacity nanodegree data analyst projects. Tasks of this project include the following:

- Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. 
- Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

The notebook tries to answer the question: Who are more likely to survive in the titanic disaster.

The titanic dataset which is used in the analysis can be downloaded with this link:

The central question of the analysis is: What variables show correlation to survival.

Based on the central question, a few starting points will be examined in detail in the following session Defining Questions for Analysis.

The notebook below will go through the data analysis process, which includes the following steps:

- Loading data
- Defining questions for analysis
- Data wrangling
- Exploring data
- Drawing conclusion

## Defining Questions for Analysis Phase

The central question of the analysis is: What variables show correlation to survival. 

Based on the central question, the following starting points will be examined in detail:

- How many passengers are there in total and how many of them have survived from the titanic disaster?
- Are passengers with better ticket class more likely to survive?
- Do male have more advantage to survice than female?
- Is it more likely to survive if a passengers travel with family together?
- Is there patterns between age and survival?
